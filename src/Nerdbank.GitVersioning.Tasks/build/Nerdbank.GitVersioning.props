    <!-- Cache modes include:
         MSBuildTargetCaching
            This is the default.
            Versions will be computed by an MSBuild target which can be shared across an entire build session via MSBuild target output caching.
         None
            Every project will compute its own version.

         Note that the choice in caching should have no bearing on the result of the versions computed - only on build perf and which systems it can work with.
